Hi there, my name is Irwin and I'm a passionate programmer. Specifically about the compilers and interpreters design and implementations.

In this repo I'll be following the tremendous blog from https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/ which explains this topic magistrally, at the end of the series *(19 chapters till now)* I'll have a non basic background about interpreter design. 

Actually I did all the series and the interpreter is pretty good but he is not able to talk yet thus I decided to unofficially continue the series while Ruslan prepares the next chapter.

If you *(like me)* are waiting for the next chapter and feeling a little impatient then good news, you can follow the unofficial series from here: https://github.com/Irwin1985/lets_build_a_simple_interpreter/blob/main/custom/read-me-fisrt.md

I hope you enjoy these chapters as well as I did ðŸ˜Ž
